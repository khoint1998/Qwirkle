   LinkedListDesign

   Flow between two LinkedLists (supposing there is no mistake from player in requesting tile):
   player request tile -> check contain ? (bool contains)
   then placing that tile on board and remove that tile from player's hand(void remove)
   player draw = add 1 tile (addBack) from tileBag (getFront when creating a node to add)
   delete that tile drawn from tileBag(deleteFront)

   constantly check game state(getSize)

   at end game state -> there will be one player still keeping tiles -> clear those tile (void clear)
